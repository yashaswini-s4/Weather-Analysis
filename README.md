# Weather-Analysis
A Python data analysis project that uncovers insights from global weather observations. Features comparative climate analytics across continents with interactive visual charts for key weather parameters.

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real-time and near real-time weather observations collected from 195 world capitals. Using Python, the dataset is analyzed to uncover insights into temperature patterns, humidity levels, wind dynamics, and precipitation trends across continents during September–October 2025.

📌 Project Objectives

✔️ Clean and preprocess the weather dataset
✔️ Analyze and visualize key weather parameters
✔️ Compare climate conditions across continents
✔️ Identify correlations between temperature, humidity, wind, and other metrics

📊 Key Visualizations

🔹 Temperature distribution across continents
🔹 Humidity variation trends
🔹 Wind speed & precipitation comparison
🔹 Heatmaps showing correlations among weather variables

🎯 Results & Insights

✔️ Significant differences in temperature patterns between continents
✔️ Humidity and precipitation show strong correlation in many regions
✔️ Higher cloud cover tends to align with lower visibility and reduced daytime periods
